Ordinal Hive Technical Interview - Ordinal Stats API

Note: the APIs offered by OKX is not legally licensed in my state, and the API offered by Magic Eden for Ordinals is severely rate limited to the point of unusability, so for the sake of demonstrating my technical abilities I have substituted the substantially less limited default Magic Eden collections API rather than their Ordinals API.

## Setup Instructions
Installations of Node, NPM, Express, and Axios required.

## Examples
http://localhost:3000/collections?limit=100&sort_by=floor_price&min_volume=5000000000

http://localhost:3000/collections/xillions

## Known Issues/Tradeoffs
